					<h3>Search</h3>
					<p>Type in the name of a food to search for it, like "apple".  If you have a recipe selected you can click "Save to Recipe" to add this food to the recipe.</p>
					<h3>Recipes</h3>
					<p>Recipes allow you to save foods together and get nutrition totals.  To create a new recipe click on the "New Recipe" button.  You will be prompted to enter a name for the recipe, and you can start adding ingredients to it!  The currently selected recipe will show in the bottom right on the menu.</p>
					<h3>Ingredients</h3>
					<p>Searched food items store their nutritional information, and can be added to recipes as ingredients.  Each recipe saves all of its ingredients and their specific amounts.  These details can be seen and edited in the recipe book.</p>

				<h3>Recipe Book</h3>
				<p>This contains all your saved recipes.  Open (or close) it with the "Recipe Book" button.  Select a recipe by clicking on its icon.  When opened you can see all the ingredients and nutritional facts about the selected recipe.</p>
				<p>Here you can also edit the name of a recipe, or delete it.  If you want to go back to looking at your searched food, click "Hide Recipe".</p>
				<p>Next to each ingredient is an option to change the amount you want in this recipe.  This number is a multiplier of the base serving size.  So if an apple is in your ingredients, it's serving size is 1 medium apple.  If you have 2 apples, change the amount to 2.00x.  Or if you have half an apple change it to 0.50x.  This will update your nutrition information and save your recipe!</p>
